# Git and GitHub tutorial for collaborative coding

This repository contains content for an interactive training course to learn the basics of git and GitHub for collaborative coding. This training is an adaptation of a course [originally offered by the USGS Data Science Branch](https://github.com/DOI-USGS/ds-gitflows-static/).

## I'm a learner

If you are someone taking this training, you are in the right place if your URL looks something like `www.github.com/[org]/learning-gitflows-[username]`, where `[org]` is an organization name (e.g. `CUAHSI` or `DOI-USGS`) and `[username]` is your username. Make note of this URL and the pattern described as it is referenced throughout the training materials.

To get started, open the file `course_guide.md` in a new tab. That file will guide you through this course. No need to read any more of this README document! 

## I'm an instructor/facilitator

If you are either facilitating a training or acting as a course contact for an individual taking the training, you should follow along with the extensive guide for someone setting up and administering the course by visiting the course facilitation guide in `course_guide_instructors.md`. Note that this file will not exist if you are in an individual learner's repository. It should only appear in the template repository: https://github.com/CUAHSI/learning-gitflows-template.
